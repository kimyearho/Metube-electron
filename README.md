### A must read
Hello.
Now many of you are using different versions. "Metube" updates very quickly. Automatic updates are not supported for versions 1.6.0 or earlier, and we cannot provide additional support. So please always keep the latest version. Thank you.
<strong>Automatic updates are supported from 1.6.x version.</strong>

### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository. The new version update is fast
To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".
<strong>If you like the program, please click on the star! It will help developers a lot.</strong>

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Roadmap
1. Multiple selection when adding video
2. Copy and move videos added to my collection
3. PouchDB Backup and Restore
4. Caching strategy
