### A must read
Hello.
Now many of you are using different versions. "Metube" updates very quickly. Automatic updates are not supported for versions 1.6.0 or earlier, and we cannot provide additional support. So please always keep the latest version. Thank you.
<strong>Automatic updates are supported from 1.6.x version.</strong>

### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference

To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Roadmap

2. Copy and move videos added to my collection
